# Introduction

Hi üëãüèº, thanks for stopping by! I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley working with the Netsys Lab where I am advised by Scott Shenker. I find interest in many facets of high tech, but have a particular curiosity when it comes to computer networks and hardware, operating systems, and network security. Non-academically, I have find an interest in cars, especially with the new and more sustainable approaches many manufacturers are picking up today, and hobby photography.
